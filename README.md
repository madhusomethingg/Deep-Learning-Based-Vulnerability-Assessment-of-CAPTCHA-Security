# Deep-Learning-Based-Vulnerability-Assessment-of-CAPTCHA-Security


CaptchaNetwork is a novel deep neural network designed to evaluate and enhance the security of CAPTCHAs, specifically focusing on alphanumeric variants prevalent in high-traffic websites. In response to the evolving threat landscape posed by deep learning technologies, this project explores vulnerabilities in traditional CAPTCHA generation systems and proposes a robust solution. Utilizing TensorFlow and Keras, CaptchaNetwork features a unique architecture with customized convolutional layers, output encoding, and transfer learning using VGG-19 from ImageNet. The model demonstrates commendable accuracy, achieving 96.5% on the training set and 96% on the testing set after 200 epochs. The README provides a comprehensive overview of the project, covering dataset generation, preprocessing techniques, model architecture, evaluation metrics, and vulnerability analysis. CaptchaNetwork stands as an effective tool in addressing cybersecurity challenges associated with CAPTCHA recognition and offers a valuable contribution to the field.
